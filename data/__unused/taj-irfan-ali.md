Irfan Ali Taj is a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter whose work has been featured on
the BBC, in South Asia Magazine, and has garnered almost a million views on YouTube for
his ASHIQI ANGAR video.
Hailing from Northern Pakistan in Mastuj, the Upper Chitral district of Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Irfan’s music preserves and promotes his roots through a fusion of
traditional and modern instrumentation. His compositions on the rabab and Chitrali sitar,
traditional folk instruments of Northern Pakistan, accompany bass, drums, guitar and lyrics
written in his native language, Khuwaar, as well as Persian and Urdu. Irfan has pioneered a
path for contemporary art in his homeland of Chitral, as well as inspiring artists to produce
work that champions their local culture. His latest album Mahal exemplifies this sentiment,
playing the warmth of his traditional Chitrali culture off the jazz and blues motifs more
suited to Karachi’s big-city experience.
