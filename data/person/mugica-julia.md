Julia Múgica is a Mexican scientist and artist currently incurring in the exploration of nature's complex processes. With an interdisciplinary background that encompasses Biology and Computational Physics, she is deeply interested in understanding how collectives make decisions that result in a behavioral synchrony. Recently, she focused her work in creative coding, where the process of creation magnifies different aspects of the same phenomena. Her work includes data analysis and visualization, modelling of animated particles, noise design from random walks algorithms, rhythm and collective patterns with interactive robots and speech-recognition artistic applications. She practices data-driven live coding and is an active member of the toplap community in Barcelona. She is also a professor at the University of Barcelona where she teaches collective behavior and complexity from a socio-computational perspective.
