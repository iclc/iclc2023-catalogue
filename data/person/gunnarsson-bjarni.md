Bjarni is a faculty member at the Institute of Sonology, Royal Conservatory, in The Hague. He is
concerned with process-based ideas. Sounds focusing on internal activity and motion. Compositions
that put into foreground behaviors, actions, fluid sound structures, fuzzy materials, or forms. His
recent research focus includes the construction of persistent synthetic environments, creative uses
of digital interrupts, and machine-listening observers that react to computer-generated sound.
