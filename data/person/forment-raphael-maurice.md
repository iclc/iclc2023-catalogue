Raphaël Maurice Forment is a contractual doctoral student at the University Jean Monnet of Saint Etienne (ECLLA Laboratory, ED 484 3LA), his thesis being carried out in collaboration with the University Paris 8 Saint-Denis (MUSIDANSE). In his work, Raphaël is interested in studying the links between techniques and aesthetic discourses that cross the field of improvised programming in computer music. He studies live coding both as an artistic practice and as a programming technique, drawing a strong tie between both dimensions. He develops software for live coding and computer music both for academic research and art practice. Raphaël is also a musician. He regularly performs on stage with the Cookie Collective or in various collectives in Lyon and Paris. He teaches live coding in France both at university and in more informal settings.

**Bubobubo** improvises fast mechanical music. He has a taste for superpositions, breaks, rhythmic and harmonic entanglements. He uses his computer as a database to tirelessly browse through sound samples and banks of synthesizers, continually altering his synthesis and his playing environment. He often pairs with modular synths, switching from ordered chaos to melancholic or joyful melodic improvisations. Bubobubo is able to type extremely fast on a keyboard, a gimmick that he often uses to great effect by chatting with the audience while jumping through hoops and loops. [Raphaël](https://raphaelforment.fr) is also the main programmer responsible for the Sardine live coding environment. He likes to create bespoke tools for live coding and electronic music.
