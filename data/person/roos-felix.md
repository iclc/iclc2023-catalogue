Felix Roos (*1991 in Germany) is a musician, programmer and dilettante researcher. After studying Computer Science and Media in Stuttgart, he decided to study Jazz and Popular Music with his trumpet in Mannheim. His background in programming, making music with various electronic devices and playing the trumpet in different constellations now flows into the act of creating and using "Strudel", which is a JavaScript based port of the TidalCycles pattern language.
