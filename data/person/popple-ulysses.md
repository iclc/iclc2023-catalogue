Ulysses Popple finds joy in giving life to 3D objects through code. Professionally, he's worked on interactive installations, visual effects pipelines, and tv shows in Android app form, but has come back to the browser as his tool of choice. His latest tool, Nodysseus, is an attempt to combine the fidelity of the visual effects world with the speed of livecode node-based editors and cram it all into one playanywhere website.
