Diego Villaseñor (Videco) is a composer, improviser, multi-instrumentalist,
philosopher and programmer, whose practice and research have developed
around the following themes: collective creation, modular composition
inspired by natural systems (particularly ecosystems), ecoacoustics,
verification, development of extended techniques, polytemporality,
microtonality, sound synthesis through acoustic instruments, ontology of
the creative-musical process. His experience as a philosopher profoundly
determines his work as a musical creator, but not only from a conceptual
aspect, but also from a practical one, providing an approach to music from
unusual perspectives and processes.
