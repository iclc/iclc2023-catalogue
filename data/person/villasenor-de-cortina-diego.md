Diego Villaseñor (Videco) is a composer, improviser, multi-instrumentalist, philosopher and programmer, whose practice and research is developed around the following topics: collective creation, modular composition and composition inspired by natural systems (particularly ecosystems), ecoacoustics, verification, development of extended techniques, polytemporality, microtonality, sound synthesis through acoustic instruments, ontology of the creative-musical process.

His experience as a philosopher profoundly determines his work as a musical creator, but not only from a conceptual aspect, but also from a practical one, promoting an approach to music from unusual perspectives and processes.
