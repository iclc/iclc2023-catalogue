Miika Alonen is a senior software architecture consultant from Finland and a part-time doctoral student in the Computer Science department of Aalto University. He is passionate about information technology, programming and art.

His main research field is linked data and semantic interoperability, but for the past few years live coding has been his main research interest and a hobby to escape from reality. He often finds himself lost in the beauty and complexity of music and mathematics and enjoys exploring and simplifying these concepts in his work and research.

Outside of his work and studies, Miika enjoys spending time with his family and taking long walks with his dog. He finds joy at the little things, such as the beauty and sounds of the nature, the symmetries, patterns and chaos, as well as the urban noises of the Helsinki city.
