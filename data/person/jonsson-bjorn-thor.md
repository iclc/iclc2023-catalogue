synth.is has been developed	by Björn Þór Jónsson, a software engineer turned doctoral research fellow who recently joined RITMO at UiO to explore further the application of quality diversity algorithms as a foundation of a sound innovation engine. Björn is looking into methods for the search and discovery of diverse patterns. Pondering	how those patterns can be applied to the generation of sound and rhythm. Considering what modes	of interaction with the	sounds are well	suited to open up possibilities	for	creative discoveries.
