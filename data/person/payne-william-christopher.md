Willie Payne ([https://williepayne.com](https://williepayne.com)) is a PhD Candidate in Music Technology at New York University, the research assistant for the NSF funded project Dancing Across Boundaries (DAB!), and the Accessible Music Technology Fellow at The Filomen M. D'Agostino Greenberg (FMDG) School.

Willie studies how technology can facilitate creative expression and open pathways for people to express themselves on their own terms. He uses a participatory approach to research in which he works closely with end-users throughout design and situates interventions in authentic learning and art making environments. His articles on accessible musical instruments and creative coding environments have been published at Human Computer Interaction venues like CHI, ASSETS, and NIME.
