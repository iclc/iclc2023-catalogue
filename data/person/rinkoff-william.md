Will Rinkoff is currently a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Science and Music. He has been producing and performing as c_robo_ for the past 3 years, and working with tidalcycles for just over 4 years. He aspires to use as little specialized hardware as possible, instead exploring ways to make a laptop musically expressive by itself and circumvent the equipment cost barrier typically required to create and perform electronic music live. He is on Instagram and post.lurk.org @c_robo_
