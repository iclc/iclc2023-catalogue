Having had instrumental lessons in playing the recorder, piano, and oboe, Daniel Kurosch Höpfner first came into contact with electroacoustic music through self-study with PureData and SuperCollider. Now pursuing a Ph.D. with a focus on implicit aesthetics in MIR systems at the Institute for Music Informatics and Musicology at the HfM Karlsruhe, his interests lie in auditory perception, audio analysis, algorithm-derived synthesis and compositional structure, improvised computer music, etc.
