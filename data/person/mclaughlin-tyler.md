R Tyler is an algorithmic artist living in San Francisco. He does live-coding music performances in TidalCycles and organizes events with AV Club San Francisco. His musical focus is algorithmic dance music production, incorporating microtonal scales, jazz harmony, world rhythms, and sound design guided by unsupervised machine learning. Leveraging his familiarity as a keyboardist, preparation for his performances often involves algorithmically converting his MIDI piano recordings into remixable code. His background in analyzing complex genomics and biophysics data guides his frequent deep dives in computational music theory. In 2022 he was a live-code performer in multiple US cities and events, including Algorithmic Art Assembly and South by Southwest, and released two live-code albums.
