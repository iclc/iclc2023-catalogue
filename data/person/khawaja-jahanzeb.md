Jahanzeb Safder Khawaja is a creative technologist, live coder, audio-visual producer, and in
2017 founded Karachi Community Radio. Through his work he has produced, programmed,
and premeditated many trends in virtual production, winning the Mozilla Builders OpenLab
Award for his Campop Live Broadcasting App, producing the Centennial Boiler Room in
Pakistan, and representing local art in the Karachi Biennale 2022 with his installation Saaz.

Returning from his higher education in America, Jahanzeb realized Pakistan lacked much of
the infrastructure present back West and took it upon himself to build that network. Since
then, Jahanzeb has archived and produced over 80 contemporary and traditional artists
across mediums, championing community and experimentation in a city lacking
opportunity in the arts. Jahanzeb has fostered a platform that works for the artist, building
a network of creatives that represent what is possible in Pakistan despite the limited
resources available.
