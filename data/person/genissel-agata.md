Agata Genissel uses audio-visual live coding to explore notionsof world-building in the realm
of live performance. Primarily using TidalCycles and Hydra to build a stage, she seeks to key 
into the fun and playful elements of musical improvisation. Relying on instinct and on the
force of the sounds and textures of these repeated patterns built using TidalCycles, Agata
delivers BRICKWORK as a moment in which people are encouraged to dance and reflect.

Based in London, Agataâ€™s performances play around with spatial characteristics. Whether
this involves ripping down paper-built walls in Venue MOT Unit 18, projecting a live feed of
the audience back into the space, or moving around to incorporate live drums and vocals into
the mix, Agata is always keen to interfere with the dimensions of live coding as something
that does not place the performer strictly behind the screen.
