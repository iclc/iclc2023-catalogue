Lucy Cheesman is a sound artist, musician, producer and organiser whose work can be placed within a number
of different fields, often blurring the boundary between the visual, the audible and the digital. Lucy is a founder
member of SONA (a network supporting women in Sheffield through experimental sound and digital practices)
and the Yorkshire Sound Women Network. Along with her artistic practice she also makes music under the
name Heavy Lifting, using software such as TidalCycles and FoxDot â€“ open-sourced coding programmes aimed
at opening up the processes of experimental music production for the benefit of the wider public. She also runs
the record label Pickled Discs, which is dedicated to promoting experimental electronic sounds.
