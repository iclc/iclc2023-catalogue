Marije Baalman is an artist and researcher/developer working in the field of interactive sound and light art, based in Amsterdam. She makes music and music-theatre performances, worked with dancers and has made several installations.

Topics that she addresses with her work are the nature of interaction between and entanglement of humans and technology, the influence of algorithms on society and the human experience, and environmental change.

She uses tools such as physical computing (performance interfaces and/or installations), livecoding (both as a skill, as well as a performance interface), digital and analog sound processing, and improvisation. In her work with light she uses methods from sound composition and synthesis. To realise her works she mostly uses open source technology (software and hardware) and she is an active contributor to the open source community.

Marije is a contributor to “The SuperCollider Book” (MIT Press, 2011) and in 2022 she publised a book titled: [“Composing Interactions - An Artist’s Guide to Building Expressive Interactive Systems”](https://composinginteractions.art/) with V2_ in Rotterdam.
