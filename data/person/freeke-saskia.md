Saskia Freeke is an artist, creative coder, interaction designer, visual designer and educator. Her work addresses structure, geometry and playfulness. A significant part of her artistic practice is the ongoing daily art project she started in January 2015, in which she explores and experiments with generative patterns and animations. Starting 2019 she has extended her practice of expression by incorporating geometry and playfulness in live coded visual performances on stage. Saskia has been a lecturer in Physical Computing at Goldsmiths, University of London and taught visual design at the University of the Arts Utrecht School for Games and Interaction.
