Kaspars Jaudzems (1984 in Riga, Latvia) is an audiovisual artist working mainly in code - designing, building, sequencing and composing using algorithms and numbers. He builds light installations / sculptures that exhibit life-like generative behaviors by using generative audiovisual compositions which are performed, manipulated and driven to their limits in a live-coding / live performance setting. His goal is to induce a new experience of physical phenomena in the minds of the audience. He is currently based in Karlsruhe, Germany.
