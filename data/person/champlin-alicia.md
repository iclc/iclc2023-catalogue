Alicia Champlin (USA, 1975) is an independent intermedial artist and researcher based in Barcelona. Champlin’s creative practices have come to focus on feedback-driven, generative systems in pursuit of the phenomenological intersection of networked communication and identity. In installations, she applies systems theory to employ sound and interaction in modeling complex and dynamic relationships. She also has performance practices both with live-coding (primarily TidalCycles) and with the bow chime (a.k.a. steel cello), which sometimes intersect. Champlin’s research interests explore cybernetic and post-structuralist issues of communication, such as agency, enactivism and perception, with process-based, interactive methodologies. Champlin received her MFA from University of Maine for a thesis based on these aims, “Rediscovering the Interpersonal: Models of Networked Communications in New Media Performance,” (University of Maine Digital Commons, 2018). Champlin has exhibited or performed in Spain, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, USA and Slovenia.
