Olivia Jack is a programmer and artist who works frequently with open-source software, cartography, live coding, and experimental interfaces. She is the developer of browser-based creative tools including Hydra (live-codable video synthesizer), PIXELSYNTH, and LiveLab (peer-to-peer media router). Her live visual sets explore algorithmic representations of unpredictable and chaotic systems, and writing software as a messy and ephemeral process.
