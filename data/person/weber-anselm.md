Anselm Weber was born in 1993. Due to his interest in contemporary music, he applied for music informatics at the
University of Music in Karlsruhe. In the course of his studies he performed more and more pieces as a composer but as well as a performer on stage. Since his first contact with the Karlsruhe Live Coding Scene, Anselm Weber developed his passion for Live Coding. First in the audience, but now on stage in various constellations and contexts.
