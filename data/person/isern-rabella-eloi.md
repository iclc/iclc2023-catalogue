Eloi Isern aka Eloi el Bon Noi (Eloi the good guy) is a composer and live coder interested in
the use of code as a tool for sound design and composition. He is an active member of the
Top Lap community in Barcelona. His conception of music is overloaded, pointillist, often
saturated, filling the screen with big blocks of code that hide complex processes and push
the CPU to the limit. He performs solo or accompanying artists in free improvisation or
spoken word sessions. He has participated in several festivals of contemporary art,
electronics and algoraves in Spain.
