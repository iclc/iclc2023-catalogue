Jakob Schreiber, born in 1992, began studying mechanical engineering after graduating from high school. Since 2017 he has been studying music informatics at the University of Music Karlsruhe. As an improvisational musician he participated in several theater projects, composed pieces realised in different institutions of Karlsruhe and performed as Live Coder in different physical and digital events of \_\\|/_ TOPLAP Karlsruhe. His musical approach often starts with live coding and sometimes spreads into haptic manifestations of ideas in the fields of physical computing. His doubt-driven form of artistic thinking results in a musical language, that is hardly recognizable and exposed to constant change.
