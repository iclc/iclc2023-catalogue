Niklas Reppel (*1983, Witten/Ruhr) is a live coder, composer and audio software developer currently based in Barcelona, where he found a home in the local TOPLAP community. Oftentimes he is more involved in making live coding tools (i.e. Mégra, his main performance software) than actually using them. Coming from a multifaceted musical background that features everything from jammy rock bands to contemporary chamber music ensembles, improvisation, eclecticism and Markov chains play a major role in his current live coding works.
