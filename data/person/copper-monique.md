Monique Copper received her musical education in Geneva, Rotterdam, Utrecht and London. While living in London she made her debut at the Purcell Room and performed worldwide as a soloist and with various ensembles such as ASKO Ensemble. Monique gives masterclasses in piano and is regularly invited as a guest lecturer on ‘Dutch Electronic Music’ at Dutch academies such as Hogeschool Inholland Haarlem. Monique Copper established not only a reputation for her innovative programs but also for her illustrated children's programs, lecture recitals and recitals with narration with a touch of theater. She collaborates with composers, writers, actors and visual artists to create new programs. Her most recent program is "Water”, a performance on the theme of water: a multimedia piano recital in which Monique combines classical and contemporary piano works with poetry and video. With "Water" Monique has toured the Netherlands, India, Vietnam, Poland, Switzerland, Singapore and Italy.
