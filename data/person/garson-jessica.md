Messica Arson is a Brooklyn-based artist who creates unique and electrifying computational noise music. Using live coding and live sampling, she incorporates sampled screams into her beats to add a raw and powerful element to her sound. Described by The Financial Times as "gnarly cut-up sounds," her music is not afraid to push the boundaries of traditional music.
