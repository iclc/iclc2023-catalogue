Aaron Juarez is an interdisciplinary artist-researcher currently residing in Troy, New York as he pursues
the PhD in Electronic Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In playing with digital structures, he
employs disjunctive strategies between art and science to engage serendipity through experimental
interactions of digital media, including photography, film, and 3d models. Embracing the art of
wandering, Juarez has expanded into physical art through screen printing and performance through live
coding visuals. His theoretical research interests include issues in creativity and cognition via humancomputer interaction, as well as topics that consider the nonhuman agency of technology. He has
contributed writings, code, and artworks to online venues and various exhibitions in America and
Europe. His investigations challenge perceptions of functionality and naturalized experience by testing
the limits of digital structures and encountering sublime moments by allowing nature and technology to
speak for themselves.
