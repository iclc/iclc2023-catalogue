experience as an accelerator technology and applied physics research assistant at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory. Since his graduation, Murtaza has worked as a technical
student at the the European Organisation for Nuclear Research’s (CERN) department of
technology, spearheaded efforts to restore the Korangi Public School in Malir, Karachi with
Pakistani NGO Akhuwat, and co-founded Mach Forty-Two, a company dedicated to

During Saaz’s development, Murtaza Tunio played a crucial role in the instrument’s
augmentation and design, working with Fablab at the Narayan Jagannath Vaidya (NJV)
Government Higher Secondary School in Karachi to build and test the prototypes and final
