We are sorry to announce to the live coding community that the insidious Click Nilson has been found alive, floating in a canoe bought from a life insurance payout off Finland or somesuch fraudulent state. Many of us thought he was gone for good, but he has returned for evil.

Rumours to the contrary, his obituary included, Click Nilson is then resolutely still around, though he has stayed hidden these past years, and may have died more than once. In one unlikely turn of events, Click Nilson was reincarnated as himself. This was the outcome thought most ironic by the powers that be, in the light of CN's stated desire for change.
