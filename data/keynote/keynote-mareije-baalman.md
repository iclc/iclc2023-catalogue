Marije Baalman will present a keynote presentation on the topic of human/machine entanglement.

Her past livecoding works, *[Code LiveCode Live](https://marijebaalman.eu/projects/code-livecode-live.html)*, *[Wezen-Gewording](https://marijebaalman.eu/projects/wezen-gewording.html)*, *[Etudes pour le Livecoding à une Main](https://marijebaalman.eu/projects/etudes-pour-le-livecoding-a-une-main.html)*, and *[the machine is learning](https://marijebaalman.eu/projects/the-machine-is-learning.html)* all address different aspects of human/machine entanglement. In her presentation she will come back to topics she addressed in her paper *[Embodiment of Code](https://iclc.toplap.org/2015/html/72.html)* at the first ICLC in 2015, her article “Interplay between Composition, Instrument Design and Performance” (2016) and her book *[“Composing Interactions – an Artist’s Guide to Building Expressive Interactive Systems”](https://composinginteractions.art/)* (2022).
