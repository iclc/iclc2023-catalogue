Our current technology hype cycle has much to say on the displacement of human labor. However, live coding can be seen as a methodology for centrally placing the artist and their process in new media artwork. How might live coding challenge the displacement of humans and give people agency in a world of technical systems and algorithms that consistently make choices for us? Live coding asks us to find humanity in computational practices and how to highlight the performers. And perhaps by putting a real-time computational process into a discipline, we may even find new ways of making through forms of displacement, introducing new vocabularies and practices, beyond the technical and reflecting the social, cultural or expressive.
