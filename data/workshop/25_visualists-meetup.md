# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Are you the person at the alogorave asking for the HDMI cable? (Do you secretly have a 10m one in your bag already?) Are you sick of everyone talking about sounds when you want to be talking about throwing shapes? Meet up with other visualists and share your questions, suggestions, works, and make new friends. Maybe commiserate a little. This workshop will be led by four visualists and tool-makers — Antonio Roberts, Guy John, Olivia Jack, and Sarah Groff Hennigh-Palermo — but its format will be determined by the needs of the attendees. It might take the form of an open projector, informal group discussion, breakout groups, or some other improvisation.
