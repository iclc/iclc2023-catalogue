# $ABSTRACT

This workshop will introduce participants to P5LIVE, a collaborative live-coding vj
environment for p5.js. Here one can create generative, audio-reactive, visuals on the fly from
scratch with only a few lines of code. Hosted by the tool's creator, Ted Davis, we'll walk
through the many features geared for both live-coding performance, remote collaboration,
and how it can be useful in a teaching environment. In the end, we'll explore a collaborative
jam session, in preparation for an open performance that will invite the audience to
participate as well.

In this workshop you'll learn: ▸ Introduction to creative coding visuals (with p5.js) ▸ Basic
math useful for animation purposes ▸ Audio-reactive code (using audio to influence visuals)
▸ Generative design ▸ Interactive design ▸ Live-coding techniques ▸ Collaborative-coding
techniques

Level : ▸ Beginner (no programming experience required)

Requirements : ▸ Laptop
