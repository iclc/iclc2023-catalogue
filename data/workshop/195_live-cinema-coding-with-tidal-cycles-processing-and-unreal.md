# $PROGRAM_NOTE

We define Live Cinema Coding as a performative practice (heir to Live cinema) that uses live coding to
sequence cinematographic shots, transform a 3D scene, animate actors, control light, process videos, etc.
We use the pattern strength of Tidal to create sound-visual synesthesia and sound visualization by refactoring
musical patterns into visual patterns.

The objective of the workshop is to show the authors' workflow, both conceptual and technical: the choice of
"what" patterns to refactor and "how" from listening to our own musical composition. Or the process of
abstracting into custom haskell functions within Tidal Cycles and converting them to OSC addresses for
redirection and flexible visual consequence in Processing, Unreal Engine or DMX stage lighting.

For the workshop it is necessary to have Tidal Cycles (supercollider), Processing and Unreal Engine already
installed and the student will be explained the resources that will be available on GitHub.
