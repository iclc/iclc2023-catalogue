# $PROGRAM_NOTE

LiveLily is a workshop on the software with the same name. This is a Live Sequencing and
Live Scoring software through live coding with a subset of the Lilypond language. Lilypond
is a language for sheet music engraving. With LiveLily the user can create music scores in
real time, and a sequencer based on these score.

The LiveLily sequencer can be as expressive as a Western notation music score can, capable
of transferring dynamics, articulation and arbitrary information to the instruments it
controls. Being a hybrid system, combining Live Scoring and Live Sequencing, LiveLily can
be used for both Live Scoring with acoustic instruments, and Live Sequencing electronic
music, or even a combination of these two.

# $ABSTRACT

LiveLily is a workshop on the software with the same name. This is a Live Sequencing and
Live Scoring software through live coding with a subset of the Lilypond language. Lilypond
is a language for sheet music engraving. With LiveLily the user can create music scores in
real time, and a sequencer based on these score.

The LiveLily sequencer can be as expressive as a Western notation music score can, capable
of transferring dynamics, articulation and arbitrary information to the instruments it
controls. Being a hybrid system, combining Live Scoring and Live Sequencing, LiveLily can
be used for both Live Scoring with acoustic instruments, and Live Sequencing electronic
music, or even a combination of these two.

The sequencer sends OSC messages, so the participants will benefit from an audio software
or programming language that supports the OSC protocol, like Pure Data, SuperCollider,
Max, etc. Without an audio software, LiveLily can be used as a Live Scoring tool, so the
participants can use acoustic instruments to play scores live through site-reading.

In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the subset of Lilypond language the
software uses and to the actual LiveLily software. They will learn the basics of the language
and how they can use that in a live context. Since it is preferable that the participants use
another software that supports OSC to create sound, they will connect LiveLily to the
software they use, to make music. If some participants have acoustic instruments, it would
be desired to setup a Live Scoring gig where some participants will be writing scores live,
and the instrumentalists will be sight reading them. Eventually, we will connect users to a
server computer for a joint coding session.
