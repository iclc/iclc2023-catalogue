# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Seis8s is a web-based live coding language that allows real-time interaction with digital
audio and localized music knowledge. Seis8s revolves around Spanish-language commands
that relate to Latin dance music. During this 4-hour introductory workshop, participants
will access Seis8s at https://seis8s.org/ to learn its basic functions as well as its context
and motivation.

Through this learning process, participants will also engage in mainstream music styles
from Latin America such as Mexican Cumbia and Cuban Guaguancó. Participants will also
learn about instruments commonly used in this music such as keyboards, bass guitars,
congas, claves, and shakers.

Luis, the instructor, will be present during the workshop ***digitally***, while we have a local instructor, Julia, present to guide you.
