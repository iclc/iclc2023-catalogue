# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In this workshop, participants will see how coding can be used in musical, performative and
literary arts, by using tools such as livecoding Youtube, Hydra, Inverse.website and Sonic Pi
to name a few. They will see how expressive and creative code will be with the benefit of
seeing how it can be use in a collaborative setting. Participants will see how improvised
writing and coding can lead to various outcomes, musically, as well as how to use network
elements to your advantage when writing or producing work.

# $ABSTRACT

In this workshop, participants will see how coding can be used in musical, performative and
literary arts, by using tools such as livecoding Youtube, Hydra, Inverse.website and Sonic Pi
to name a few. They will see how expressive and creative code will be with the benefit of
seeing how it can be use in a collaborative setting. Participants will see how improvised
writing and coding can lead to various outcomes, musically, as well as how to use network
elements to your advantage when writing or producing work.

In addition to the tidbit above from a previous workshop Expressing Oneself through Code:
Coding Beyond the Screen, we will also be looking at how we can take things from our
everyday life and put them in alignment. This will take a look at how we can use our own
lives to provide data to our code, adding data visualization and sonification to the mix.
This allows one to not only be able to express themselves but create a little universe of their
choosing. 

This framework has been used to make works of horror, sci-fi and fantasy type works and
adjacent.

It will showcase how things like data analytics and creative coding can help with things seen
in the fantasy/horror genre. From Name generation, Race & Class creation to even building
out the tedious and nuisances of building things such as language, spell casting and history
in said places.
