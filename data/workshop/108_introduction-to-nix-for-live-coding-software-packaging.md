# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This workshop will provide a guided introduction to Nix (https://nixos.org/),
a functional package manager for declarative configuration of general
software dependencies. The workshop will consist of:

- An introduction to the principles of declarative software dependency
management.
- A guided tutorial to the Nix language.
- A presentation of common packaging examples and patterns.
- On-site tutoring packaging the live-coding software chosen by the
participant.

Requirements for participation: bring your personal laptop to work during
the practical part of the workshop. Windows users are encouraged to come
with a Linux Virtual Machine. Nix can work from within the Windows 
Subsystem for Linux, albeit with some limitations compared to native \*nix
systems.

It is highly recommended that participants come with their own project to
package, or a project they already want to use but could not manage to
make it work in a specific setup.

# $ABSTRACT

A common pattern around live-coding software is that it tends to be hard to
install for the average user. The reasons vary greatly, from authors not
having the appropriate background or resources to package their projects
for a big array of end-user platforms, to the sheer complexity of software
dependencies in some projects.

There is a subset of live-coding tools that use web technologies, treating
browsers as universal virtual machine platforms, in order to make their
software more accessible. This is a line of practice/development with value
of its own. However, as a community we would greatly benefit from
lowering the barrier of entrance to more complex stacks for a wider and
more inclusive reach. A tool that can help nudging the live-coding
ecosystem towards this goal is the package manager Nix.

This workshop will provide a guided introduction to Nix (https://nixos.org/),
a functional package manager for declarative configuration of general
software dependencies. The following will be covered in the workshop:

- An introduction to the principles of declarative software dependency
management.
- A guided tutorial to the Nix language.
- A presentation of common packaging examples and patterns.
- On-site tutoring packaging the live-coding software chosen by the
participant.

No previous Nix experience is required to participate in this workshop.
Participants with Nix knowledge might be interested in the practical part of
the workshop.

Participants will need to bring their personal laptop to setup Nix and get
hands on experience packaging software. Windows users are encouraged to
come with a Linux Virtual Machine. Nix can work from within the Windows
Subsystem for Linux, albeit with some limitations compared to native \*nix
systems.

Anybody curious enough is welcomed to join but the following profiles will
potentially benefit the most from participating in this workshop:

- Students with interest on declarative software dependency
management.
- Live-coding software developers that want to package their
dependencies in a more holistic way,
- Live-coders wanting to learn how to manage complex software stacks
for their performances and research.

It is highly recommended that participants come with their own project to
package, or a project they already want to use but could not manage to
make it work in a specific setup.
