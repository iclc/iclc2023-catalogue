# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Scorch is a new domain specific music programming language designed by Norah Lorway,
Edward Powley and Arthur Wilson with the intention of being an accessible entry point for those
not experienced in traditional programming languages (Lorway et al 2022). Initially used for
algorithmic composition as a MIDI generating VST plugin, Scorch is also being used for live
coding and a variety of media computing applications.

Scorch incorporates various AI implementations meant to assist users with various musical and
computing tasks. Amongst these include an AI collaborator called Autopia (Lorway et al 2021)
which allows for collaboration with AI and human performers in live coding contexts. Autopia
was designed by the present authors to explore the three-way interaction between AI, human
performer and audience — the AI uses an evolutionary algorithm seeded with human-written
code and guided by live audience feedback. Originally developed for use with SuperCollider,
this workshop will be the debut of the version of Autopia developed for use with Scorch.

# $ABSTRACT

Scorch is a new domain specific music programming language designed by Norah Lorway,
Edward Powley and Arthur Wilson with the intention of being an accessible entry point for those
not experienced in traditional programming languages (Lorway et al 2022). Initially used for
algorithmic composition as a MIDI generating VST plugin, Scorch is also being used for live
coding and a variety of media computing applications.

Scorch incorporates various AI implementations meant to assist users with various musical and
computing tasks. Amongst these include an AI collaborator called Autopia (Lorway et al 2021)
which allows for collaboration with AI and human performers in live coding contexts. Autopia
was designed by the present authors to explore the three-way interaction between AI, human
performer, and audience — the AI uses an evolutionary algorithm seeded with human-written
code and guided by live audience feedback. Originally developed for use with SuperCollider,
this workshop will be the debut of the version of Autopia developed for use with Scorch.
During this proposed workshop, we will give an overview of Scorch, introduce its uses including
a demonstration of its use with Autopia.

Participants will get a hands-on experience with using Scorch in live coding performance
contexts culminating in a collaborative group performance at the end of the session.
Participants will be given a clear handbook with documentation and help files to refer to
throughout the session.

As Scorch is meant to be an accessible, welcoming way to bring together users of multiple skill
levels into the world of digital music production, AI and computing, this workshop will be open to
skill levels ranging from beginners to advanced. Since Scorch integrates with existing Digital
Audio Workstation (DAW) software, it is useful (but not required) if participants have basic
knowledge of such software.
