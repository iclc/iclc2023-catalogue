This evening's artists are not afraid of a challenge: each will create both music and visuals in real time for their performances. This seamless collaboration between sound and visuals will transport you into imaginary worlds and sensational adventures.

Thanks to the Quad audio system - set up especially for this A/V night - you will not only hear the music, but feel it in your bones.
