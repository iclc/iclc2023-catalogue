# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Pirarán is a networked ensemble that hallucinates with mad light-ganglia
and one-legged silences. Their algorithmic acid music oscillates between
the aridity and emptiness of the post-end of time. The ensemble is made up
of Iván López (Morelia, MX), Diego Villaseñor (Mexico City, MX) and Alejandro
Franco Briones (Ontario, CA).

# $ABSTRACT

Pirarán is a networked ensemble of algorithmic acid music that combines
the sound of analogue and digital synthesisers with live coded soundscapes
and dance vectors. Pirarán attempts to provide (audio)visions of a world
beyond the post-end of times. The band is influenced by Xeno-harmonic and
poly-temporal music forums, Latin-American popular modernism (Pérez
Parado, Cumbia chichadélica, and MicoRex), and music genres like
vaporwave, hippie synth music, techno, glitch, industrial, ambient and
noise. Pirarán also draws extensively (and expropriates when deemed fit)
from ideas, words and visions that give meaning to the music like Mark
Fisher, David Graeber, Ursula K. Le Guinn, Mario Santiago Papasquiaro,
Nancy Fraser, Manuel Maples Arce, Gayatri Spivak and Heriberto Yépez.
Pirarán has existed since early 2022 when they recorded the side A of the
_Algorithmic Acid Music_ album. They had a mini-tour that summer
performing in Morelia and Mexico City. They later released _A la vørtex_ for
the label Cjantal in the anthology Nijbla. In the fall 2022 they performed at
the legendary music venue the Phog in Windsor (Canada) and they estimate
2023 will be the year of the premiere of the side B of the album and perhaps
even a side C. The ensemble is made up by Iván López (Morelia, MX), Diego
Villaseñor (Mexico City, MX) and Alejandro Franco Briones (Hamilton, Ontario,
CA).
