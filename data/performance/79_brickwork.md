# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This iteration of BRICKWORK explores destruction as something that has the potential for
regeneration. Live coding using TidalCycles, Hydra, as well as incorporating live drums and
vocals, this synthesis of the digital, percussive and vocal expands on the relationship
between technology and performer as something that is symbiotic, playful, erroneous and
against notions of rigid control. In exploring the physical space away from the laptop screen,
BRICKWORK uncovers the potential for performance in-between live coding and live
instrumentation.

Challenging the relationship between artist and tool as one that seeks to fulfil technological
idealism by playing with visual, spatial and sonic dynamics, ‘DESTROY’ seeks to
simultaneously build and destroy structures of sound and textures in attempt to capture a
moment that embraces paradox through playfulness. It is in this frenzy of live improvisation
and costume-fueled expression that BRICKWORK seeks to destroy the impulse to resist
destruction itself – please dance!

# $ABSTRACT

Using TidalCycles to simultaneously build and destroy repeating patterns of sound, this
iteration of BRICKWORK titled ‘DESTROY’ embraces chaos as a positive allied force, serving
as a line for escape. I use both Tidal and Hydra to live code the sound and visuals, also
incorporating live vocals and drums to add dynamics that are physically present within the
space. In fusing these contrasting, yet perhaps equally ‘raw’ forms of instrumentation, the
intent is to create a moment charged with sensitivity and intensity, one that feels precarious
and authentic in its plight to build chaos and destroy the impulse to resist it.

Inspired by the Algorave scene and TidalCycles itself, live coding has allowed me to explore
live performance in a new dimension; as something that explicitly hinges on the possibilities
of spontaneity, playfulness, and creates a working relationship between artist and tool in
real-time. I will build a structure that exponentially brings in layers of sound, with visuals
that evoke imagery of destruction and potential for regeneration, building to a climax
wherein the elements strip back and the vocals and drums join in with the electronic
components. Incorporating live percussion, vocals, a glitched-out live feed of the audience
projected back at them and audience interaction via engaging with the space physically, the
performance expands on the act of live coding as something that does not happen purely
behind the screen. It is this relationship between the digital and the physical that interests
me as something that is mutual rather than opposed. In resisting technological idealism, this
performance’s intent is to reflect the margins of chaos as a disruptive force - an upsurgence
of the DIY, fun and erroneous that may challenge our overwrought desire for order.
