# $PROGRAM_NOTE

c0l1v3 is a collaborative live codable open web platform and instrument
created by Bruno Gola. For ICLC 2023 Bruno proposes a collaborative
performance session where the local audience can join him and play with
their mobile phones and laptops, and remote collaborators can join from
home.

# $ABSTRACT

c0l1v3 is a collaborative live codable open web platform and instrument
created by Bruno Gola. The idea behind c0l1v3 is to experiment with
breaking the traditional workflow of writing code from top to botom, and to
create a canvas where the performer(s) can write code anywhere and go
back and forth between changes. Inspired in Utopia Quark of SuperCollider,
c0l1v3 is written in JavaScript and uses SuperCollider in the backend
together with tcposcrouter and HyperDisCo quarks to enable collaboration
between performers in different locations. It runs as a website so it is
available to anyone with a browser-enabled device.
