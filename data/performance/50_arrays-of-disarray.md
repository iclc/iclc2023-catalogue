# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In her performance "Arrays of Disarray," Brooklyn-based artist Messica Arson will use live
coding in Python with FoxDot and custom scripts to create a dynamic and electrifying
experience. She will also incorporate live sampling of her own screams, and use Hydra to
create a chaotic yet mesmerizing visual world. This promises to be a one-of-a-kind
performance.

# $ABSTRACT

In the performance "Arrays of Disarray," Messica Arson will use live coding in FoxDot to
experiment with unusual sounds and textures. She will also blend live coding with modular
synthesis, and incorporate live sampling of her own screams using custom Python scripting.
The use of both analog and digital technology in live-coded music adds a layer of warmth
and richness to the sound.

This performance will combine sound and visuals to create a captivating, glitchy, and
vibrant experience. Using Hydra for real-time video manipulation, the audience will be
drawn into the world of audio and visual glitches.

In this work, the tension between creation and destruction will be explored. The
performance will investigate the conflicting desires to build something beautiful and to tear
it apart.
