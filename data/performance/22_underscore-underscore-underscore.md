# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Can algorithms be collaborative? What happens when the Borromean knot is applied to network structures? Can we communicate through numbers? In this performance, the network music ensemble [ _ _ _ ] presents its thoughts on these questions. The members of the ensemble will each live-code their algorithms on their laptops connected through a communication mechanism they have created, the algorithms being live-interpreted into sound in the concert room. The data communication mechanism was developed from scratch during the Covid lockdown in 2020 using the programming language SuperCollider. Their system is mainly based on message transmission. Each member plays the role of a node, sending and receiving messages. They could define and modify the algorithms to reform message chains and time/frequency intervals respectively. Writing and changing rules on the fly, they listen to each other through subtle changes in the sound resulting from their in-time communication.

Can algorithms be collaborative? What happens when the Borromean knot is applied to network structures? Can we communicate through numbers? In this performance, the network music ensemble [ _ _ _ ] presents its thoughts on these questions. The members of the ensemble will each live-code their algorithms on their laptops connected through a communication mechanism they have created, the algorithms being live-interpreted into sound in the concert room. The data communication mechanism was developed from scratch during the Covid lockdown in 2020 using the programming language SuperCollider. Their system is mainly based on message transmission. Each member plays the role of a node, sending and receiving messages. They could define and modify the algorithms to reform message chains and time/frequency intervals respectively. Writing and changing rules on the fly, they listen to each other through subtle changes in the sound resulting from their in-time communication. Their research and practice embody a new form of computer music performance through theoretical thinking. The ensemble approaches and works between composition and improvisation, which often happens in specific spaces, that are intertwined with the exploration of physical movement and auditory perception. Their compositions are mainly based on sine waves and additive synthesis and the performers prefer to have no boundary between stage and auditorium - the three performers might change their seats during the performance and the audience could wander in the space to experience the subtle acoustic differences of the sound characters.
