# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This performance is part of a practice-based PhD that comprises embodied and choreographic techniques to inform the development of methods and tools for designing of web-interfaces — driven by transparency and legibility. Joana Chicau will present early prototypes such as custom interfaces and plug-ins that aim at responding to the opaque algorithmic models embedded in pervasive web interfaces. For instance, by exposing user-tracking and phenomena such as ‘dark patterns’ through live performance. She will interweave live coding using JavaScript commands on the web console and custom browser tools with voice narration following a choreographic perspective.

# $ABSTRACT

This performance is part of a practice-based PhD that comprises embodied and choreographic techniques to inform the development of methods and tools for designing of web-interfaces — driven by transparency and legibility. It draws from a body of work [1] that explores how choreography provides alternative insights on how algorithms shape web environments. In a similar vein, various embodied tactics have been emerging for making sense of the complexities in algorithmic systems — including Experiential AI [2] that focus on felt experience and Graspable AI [3] that uses physical artefacts as a relational way of interpreting algorithms. Joana Chicau will present early prototypes such as custom interfaces and plug-ins that aim at responding to the opaque algorithmic models [4] embedded in pervasive web interfaces. For instance, by exposing user-tracking and phenomena such as ‘dark patterns’ [5] through live performance. She will interweave live coding using JavaScript commands on the web console and custom browser tools with voice narration following a choreographic perspective. [1] J.
