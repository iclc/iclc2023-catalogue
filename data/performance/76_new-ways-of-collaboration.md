# $PROGRAM_NOTE

In this Algorave performance Sabrina is exploring the possibilities of collaborating with a large
machine learning model in a live coding setting.

# $ABSTRACT

*New Ways of Collaboration* is a live coded collaboration experiment. Sabrina Verhage as a media
artist and live coder has been experimenting with ways to collaborate with the machine in a live
coding setting. Inspired by new ways of collaboration through what is popularly called
‘prompting’ she’s been tempted to implement this new way of collaboration in a live coding
setting. One live coded set she has collaborated with Lexica.art https://lexica.art/ , live coding
visuals in P5LIVE while also porting a description of those visuals for Lexica to interpret.
Considering the current machine learning climate there are many more opportunities to
experiment with this type of collaboration with the machine.
