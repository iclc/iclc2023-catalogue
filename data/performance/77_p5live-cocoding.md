# $PROGRAM_NOTE

At this participatory performance the barrier between the audience and the performers will be
blurred. Rather than facing the audience, the performers will join them as multiple machines
invite anyone to join the P5LIVE COCODING session. Starting from scratch, the shared
codebase will extend, break, tweak, grow in complexity, and ideally bring us all to new
unexpected visual territories. So join in and COCODE with us!

# $ABSTRACT

A P5LIVE COCODING performance hosted by Ted Davis and Sabrina Verhage; a setup with
multiple computers contributing to one visual spectacle.

Algorave-type events can be intimidating because of the exposure the coder gets on stage as
well as sharing their screen and code in front of the audience. The proposal of a COCODING
performance aims to generate an environment where the audience feels welcome to contribute
and try it out themselves too. Sabrina & Ted would act as performance MCs, bringing the code
in certain directions (while probably fixing bugs), while encouraging those within the
COCODING session to continue tweaking and extending where the visuals take us. It may create
synergetic harmony or complete chaos â€“ something that can't be anticipated until performed
live.

Ted Davis created P5LIVE, a collaborative live-coding vj environment for p5.js. P5LIVE came
about at the end of 2018, inspired by the global Processing Community Day and an
Algorave-like party as part of it. Similar to Hydra, P5LIVE works in the browser; fullscreen
visuals in the background with a text editor on top. Sabrina Verhage, as a long time Processing
fan, uses P5LIVE for all her live coding algorave-type performances.

In the summer of 2019 Ted Davis implemented a function called COCODING. P5LIVE has a great
potential as a low threshold entry language and tool into the live coding scene. Additionally
COCODING as a feature of P5LIVE has become a useful and important tool for teaching in
remote-teaching times.
