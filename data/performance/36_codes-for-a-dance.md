# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This piece explores movement through textual, visual and physical communication. It focuses on language, patterns and the performance of gestures as a way to bridge the digital and the physical. Through a series of live coded actions, connections will be made from humans to machines and back to humans again.

# $ABSTRACT

This performance focuses on a developing notational system that allows for live coding of movements of both human dancers and robots. We will oscillate between fleshy and robotic movements in order to expose the relationship between them, and their contrasting efforts in motion. Through the use of simple gestures combined into complex patterns, choreography emerges from hand-made algorithmic structures. 

The performance itself involves two human performers and additional robot performers. Each human performer codes and moves in various patterns to create a live choreographic performance with the robotic movers, accompanied by sound. A new, developing notation for movement is used to live code the performance and is projected in the performance space.
