# $PROGRAM_NOTE

AUTO{}Construcción is an audiovisual concert of live coding and algorithm-based video game experience that explores the relationship between speculative architecture and the phenomena of informal housing executed by "non-architects" in countries such as Mexico, the United States, Latin America, Asia, India and some European peripheries, collaboratively creating 3D imaginaries with machine learning. The audiovisual  immersion is guided by text and also by an avatar.

# $ABSTRACT

AUTO{}Construcción is an audiovisual concert of live coding and algorithm-based video game experience that  explores the relationship between speculative architecture and the phenomena of informal housing executed  by "non-architects" in countries such as Mexico, the United States, Latin America, Asia, India and some  European peripheries, collaboratively creating 3D imaginaries with machine learning. The audiovisual  immersion is guided by text and also by an avatar.

This research on live coding through scenic hybridizations close to live cinema, immersive experiences and  video games began with the support of the "on the fly" ZKM residency. Technically, the system has evolved allowing to imagine and create scenarios and narratives from the keyboard and the body. 

The work also reflects on the challenges that were proposed to the collective imagination of "the cyberpunk  megalopolises of the future" in the 60s, 70s and 80s and the great changes in those paradigms. Did the time  machine visit any of humanity's many possible multiverses? Or is it just that the future has changed and so  has the speculation of its urban environment that seems closer to the stark and changing social and economic phenomena throughout our world? In our present, habitability is deciphered from the urgency of occupation, desire, imitation and counterproposal through new formal languages of the "informal style" generated from years and years of self-construction, self-taught, autonomous design and collective learning.

This research and ongoing work wants to find these "new styles" generated from years and years of self-construction, autonomous and collective learning that have generated great knowledge; It also seeks to hybridize these styles in their similarities and differences from a "digital miscegenation" now possible with the collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence.
