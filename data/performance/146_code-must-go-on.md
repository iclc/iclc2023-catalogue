# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This performance is based on the theatrical aspect of a stage, how in this sense code can be used not just for visuals but more as a concept for a live show. The intention is also to combine physical and digital aspects with code, like VR spaces, physical DMX lights and robot puppies performing. Transforming the code into an universal multiplexer device that is also an actor in the scene.
