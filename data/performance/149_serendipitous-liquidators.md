# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Serendipitous Liquidation describes the practice of live coding that reuses, remixes, and repurposes
creative code by various authors in live performances. The limitless aesthetic possibilities of openly
published code snippets are harnessed in experimental, improvisatory, and playful modes. This practice
paves the way for the development of commons-centric ecosystems that are supported by Distributed
Ledger Technologies. The performance engages with SuperCollider tweets and Hydra sketches
composed by various creative coders. All the authors are cited on screen and in the credits.
