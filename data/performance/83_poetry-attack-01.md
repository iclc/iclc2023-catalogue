# $PROGRAM_NOTE

How many women are here? How many black people are here? How many black women
are here? In these times of displacement, it is necessary to think about it. In this show, artist Mari Moura (1st Minister of the Sensible State) carries out a poetry attack using live coding and text writing to questioning the absence of women, black people, and black women at live coding events and spaces. The absence of women, black people and black women is not natural, it is part of a systematic racist system that promotes exclusion. The performance act is a micro-activist action that invites the live coding community to reflect on the roles and opportunities to propose a movement of displacement and change regarding the absence of women, black people and black women. The performance is composed by sound art and performance art, synthesizers and sound samples will be manipulated by live coding through the free software platform Sonic Pi.
