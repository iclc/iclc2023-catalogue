# $PROGRAM_NOTE

People have danced to algorithms throughout history, including the Ancient Greeks. Epiploke is such an algorithm, evident in fragments of Ancient Greek texts, where metrical short-long structure is shifted in patterns. In
this performance Lucy Cheesman and Alex McLean will explore Ancient Greek narratives and patterns with live
code, bringing together fragments of structures from different texts, including instances of epiploke, as well as
incorporating audio descriptions from Homer and reconstructions of Homeric instrumentation.

# $ABSTRACT

People have danced to algorithms throughout history, including the Ancient Greeks. Epiploke is such an algorithm, evident in fragments of Ancient Greek texts, where metrical short-long structure is shifted in patterns.
Epiploke is also the name of a collaboration between Sheffield algorave scene stalwarts and from-scratch TidalCycles live coders Heavy Lifting (aka Lucy Cheesman) and Yaxu (aka Alex McLean).
In this performance Lucy Cheesman and Alex McLean will explore Ancient Greek narratives and patterns with
live code, bringing together fragments of structures from different texts, including instances of epiploke, as well
as incorporating audio descriptions from Homer and reconstructions of Homeric instrumentation.
Both Lucy and Alex have considered the relationship between Ancient Greek lyric and TidalCycles patterns before,
Lucy through bringing them together in an experimental performance of Sophocles’ Antigone, bringing together
choral dance with tidal patterns. Less directly, Alex worked with mathematician and textile artist Ellen HarliziusKlück and philologist Giovanni Fanfani and on considering cyclic patterns of movement across epiploke, weaving
and live coding. Despite the name of their duo, the proposed performance will be the first time that they have
brought these interests together in their collaboration.
