# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Dip in Code takes up the concept of chromesthesia (i.e. hearing colour/seeing sound) while allowing the audience
the pleasure of tasting colors and seeing taste while hearing it at the same time. Dip in
Code: Kitchen of Hues, takes colors that happen to be named after food. To give an
audiovisual experience that crosses over to an immersive culinary setting/dining
experience as well. Every track isn’t a single color like its predecessor but will be named
after meals that are also names of colours. The soundtrack of each meal is coded and
visualized to make sure the meal is represented well. Enjoy that colorful byte.

Dip in Code takes up the concept of chromesthesia (i.e. hearing colour/seeing sound) while allowing the audience
the pleasure of tasting colors and seeing taste while hearing it at the same time. Dip in

Dip In Code takes Narrative Design, Mathematical Fiction, Data Analyzation, Data
Visualization, Livecoding, Data Sonification, Creative Coding and merges them within
themselves and other mediums to produce an experience that stems from the premise of
everything being linked. It is an interesting component of the Colorscape Universe with its
own building and evolution grounded in the numbers it holds.
