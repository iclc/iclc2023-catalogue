# $ABSTRACT

Patterns in modulation is a collaboration between two creative coders, Sebastián Pappalardo aka. eerie_ear and Blaž Pavlica. Through code improvisations, they generate meandering and evolving patterns and textures that create subtle and interweaved soundscapes and music, intended to challenge the audience’s sense impressions and create a compelling immersive experience.

The performers sensitively connect through a generative art improvisation performance which is designed to acoustically engage the audience in an exploration of the sensorium making it a very physical and tangible audience interaction. Eerie_ear will use samples of acoustic recordings, transforming them playfully, hiding and revealing them as sources. He will use TidalCycles, midi and Max/MSP to create a cohesive set of sonic movement and textures. Blaž uses SuperCollider to synthesize and generate folding and undulating sound masses in space. 

A combination of improvisation and composition is the methodology they will use, creating moods and moments prescriptively yet allowing for free interaction between them. The performance has also been designed with the concept of space as a major consideration. The church setting is a perfect environment for sound and time driven experimentation.
