# $PROGRAM_NOTE

*flux* treats ideas of “perceptual” displacement. The piece involves two apposite elements: the notorious Shepard-Risset glissando and continuously fluctuating rhythms. Ever-shifting anchor points amidst the sonic substance blur the lines between movement and stasis. Not aiming to create a general confusion of the senses nor to deconstruct 4-to-the-floor tropes, I would rather like to suggest immersive qualities.

As often the case in my live-coding practice, I start from minimal pre-written code in SuperCollider, constituting the basic skeleton of the composition/performance, designed to explore certain sonic areas of interest as well as to afford entering uncharted territory; in this sense I always liked Xenakis’ image of the composer (and here I include the notions of performer/improviser) as a pilot supervising “the controls of a cosmic vessel sailing in the space of sound” *(Formalized Music)*.

# $ABSTRACT

I would like to start with a little thought, relating to the main theme of this year’s conference, as to how powerful and wondrous an effect the sounding displacement of a medium’s particles may have on us. As obvious and naive as this may sound, it could perhaps provide cause for ample reflection.
