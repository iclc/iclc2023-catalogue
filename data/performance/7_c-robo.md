# $PROGRAM_NOTE

A livecoding performance with one person, one laptop, a digital feedback patch, and hundreds of wav files (most of which are drum loops). The audio will be a blend of algorave, hardcore breaks, industrial hip-hop, and harsh noise. Feel free both to dance and/or lay on the ground in front of the subwoofer.

# $ABSTRACT

The performance will consist of a livecoding set using tidalcycles and SuperDirt inside neovim with no external hardware. The code is half composed, half improvised. The improvised component comes from a small performance system made inside neovim allowing for faster control of pattern streams and effects. This turns the laptop becomes a more gestural instrument, where everything is still controlled through a repel but keystrokes have a more 1:1 correspondence with changes in sound. The result can be described as 30 minutes of continuous glitchy experimental industrial hiphop techno harsh noise, all fluidly transitioning between each other.
