# $ABSTRACT

Commuta is a cross-adaptive laptop ensemble in which computers share audio signals, extract expressive characteristics, and adjust their behavior adaptively. Three performers improvise by modifying such relationships, reconfiguring the software on-the-fly, and exploring how changes propagate through a network of influences. In Commuta, live coders are not in control, but part of a shifting network of relationships between humans, computers and sounds. The joint result seeks for an emergent complexity lying at the intersection of the the three performer’s individual practices: the development of adaptive sonic processes in live coding by Francesco Corvi (nesso.xyz), Giulia Rae’s exploration of machine listening techniques for environmental synthetic soundscapes, and Riccardo Ancona’s study on material identities in corpus manipulations. The algorithmic environments used by these 3 performers represent an excellent case for creating a cross adaptive laptop ensemble, as they all individually already use adaptive sound processes that can interplay with each other.
