# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The Nieuw Ballet is an audio-visual journey through web environments and information displays performed on the CodeKlavier. As the name suggests, The Nieuw Ballet offers a new perspective on ballet by creating a ballet with non-human interpreters; a JavaScript dance driven by live piano-coding. Musically, the Nieuw Ballet is based on Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, chosen here for both its incredible music and its iconic positioning within ballet history where the premier performance was met with outrage due to Diaghilev’s ground breaking choreography. 

Similarly, the Nieuw Ballet challenges some of the conventions of live coding. Thanks to the CodeKlavier, the coding in this work is done via the piano and the form of the piece is quite firmly set in advance. Whilst there is some space for live additions, overall the piano-coder must adhere to the score and order whilst successfully executing the code. These limitations create a unique challenge.

# $ABSTRACT

The Nieuw Ballet is an audio-visual journey through web environments and information
displays performed on the CodeKlavier[^1]. As the name suggests, The Nieuw Ballet offers a new perspective on ballet by creating a ballet 
with non-human interpreters; a JavaScript
dance driven by live piano-coding. Musically, the Nieuw Ballet is based on Stravinsky’s Rite
of Spring, chosen here for both its incredible music and its iconic positioning within ballet
history where the premier performance was met with outrage due to Diaghilev’s ground
breaking choreography.

[^1]: The CodeKlavier is a system which enables the pianist to live code by playing the piano.
More in-depth information about the CodeKlavier can be read in the chapter “The
CodeKlavier: appropriating the piano as a live coding instrument” in Rethinking the Musical
Instrument by Veinberg and Noriega edited by Mine Dogantan and seen on the website
codeklavier.space.

Similarly, the Nieuw Ballet challenges some of the conventions of live coding. Thanks to
the CodeKlavier, the coding in this work is done via the piano and the form of the piece is
quite firmly set in advance. Whilst there is some space for live additions, overall the
piano-coder must adhere to the score and order whilst successfully executing the code.
These limitations create a unique challenge.

At the core of this work is the CodeKlavier which is developed by Felipe Ignacio Noriega
and Anne Veinberg. The Nieuw Ballet concept and code is developed by Joana Chicau, who
is known for her hybrid scores-scripts that link choreographic concepts with
web-programming functions. For the Nieuw Ballet she has developed a vocabulary of code
based on classic ballet — with a twist.

By connecting the piano keyboard with the web console on the browser, CodeKlavier will be
triggering, juxtaposing and manipulating web actions, performing a myriad of interactions
in the computer screen for the audience to follow.
