# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The Nieuw Ballet is an audio-visual journey through web environments and information displays performed on the CodeKlavier. As the name suggests, The Nieuw Ballet offers a new perspective on ballet by creating a ballet with non-human interpreters; a JavaScript dance driven by live piano-coding. Musically, the Nieuw Ballet is based on Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, chosen here for both its incredible music and its iconic positioning within ballet history where the premier performance was met with outrage due to Diaghilev’s ground breaking choreography. Similarly, the Nieuw Ballet challenges some of the conventions of live coding. Thanks to the CodeKlavier, the coding in this work is done via the piano and the form of the piece is quite firmly set in advance. Whilst there is some space for live additions, overall the piano-coder must adhere to the score and order whilst successfully executing the code. These limitations create a unique challenge.
