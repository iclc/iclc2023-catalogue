# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Shall we? is a trio that exists in multiple simultaneous sonic
temporalities. Their sound is a mystical deja-vu of a traverso baroque
flute, algorithmic coding texturality and a voice that escapes time
while tracing narratives. Their phantasmagoric sonic world is this
time accompanied by a visual imagery of their own expressions,
modulated and reconstructed in real-time, melting, undulating and
folding on itself.

Sebastián Pappalardo aka. eerie_ear codes and creates a strong,
intuitive rhythmic and harmonic (at times dissonant and pulseless)
foundation on which Dorota Matejová expressively plays her primary
traverso baroque flute (tuned at 415 Hz) along with other flutes,
winds and sometimes vocal sounds. Tisa N. Herlec sources words and
narratives from her lived experience and various sources, and
intertwines mythical poetry (in English language) with the sonic
scape, at times escaping language and extending her voice with various
techniques. Blaž Pavlica and eerie_ear use real-time videos of the
performers and process them into a live and expressive visual
accompaniment, the visual performers will react and interact in the
same spirit as the music, using subtle and interweaved processes that
will challenge the audience’s impressions and create a compelling
addition to the totality of this magical, aleatory and ambiental
construction.

# $ABSTRACT

Shall we? is a trio that exists in multiple simultaneous sonic
temporalities. Their sound is a mystical deja-vu of a traverso baroque
flute, algorithmic coding texturality and a voice that escapes time
while tracing narratives. Their phantasmagoric sonic world is this
time accompanied by a visual imagery of their own expressions,
modulated and reconstructed in real-time, melting, undulating and
folding on itself.

Sebastián Pappalardo aka. eerie_ear codes and creates a strong,
intuitive rhythmic and harmonic (at times dissonant and pulseless)
foundation on which Dorota Matejová expressively plays her primary
traverso baroque flute (tuned at 415 Hz) along with other flutes,
winds and sometimes vocal sounds. Tisa N. Herlec sources words and
narratives from her lived experience and various sources, and
intertwines mythical poetry (in English language) with the sonic
scape, at times escaping language and extending her voice with various
techniques. Blaž Pavlica and eerie_ear use real-time videos of the
performers and process them into a live and expressive visual
accompaniment, the visual performers will react and interact in the
same spirit as the music, using subtle and interweaved processes that
will challenge the audience’s impressions and create a compelling
addition to the totality of this magical, aleatory and ambiental
construction.

The performers, although coming from different musical backgrounds,
sensitively connect through a surprisingly acoustic and in that sense
very physical and tangible quality of their interactions, whether
these come from acoustic (voice and flute) or digital (recorded
sounds, coding) source and present performing tools. This specific
approach naturally present in this group´s performances creates the
feeling of something very human, primal and relatable for their
audience.

Improvisation is a common methodology that we all use in our
performance, it joins us in the same space and time and allows us to
interact fluidly, joining all of our different fields of references
and expertise into one coherent whole. Our differences are what makes
us sonically and performatively interesting, and provide us with a
welcomed challenge of inter-synthesis.

Here is a list of our diverse references:
- Blaž: Kazimir Malevich, Nam June Paik, Ursula K. Le Guin
- Dorota: Jed Wentz, Nina Simone, Ono no Komachi
- Tisa: Laurie Anderson, Sainkho Namtchylak, Italo Calvino
- Sebastian: Raime, Naoto Ieda, Marshall McLuhan
- & many others.
… and our prior art, disciplines and expertise (more thoroughly
described in our bios).
