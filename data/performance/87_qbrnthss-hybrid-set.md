# $PROGRAM_NOTE

QBRNTHSS hybrid set is a performance using live coding and acoustic and electronic instruments, including trumpet, processed contact mic, and some effect pedals. In his performances, we can find Ramon Casamaj贸 (a.k.a. QBRNTHSS) riding the tension between the rhythm and the abstraction, the melody and the noise, the synthetic and the analogic. Hardly influenced by avant-garde musicians that have experimented with the limits of electronic music, like Jon Hassell or Moritz Von Oswald, Ramon Casamaj贸 tries to use live coding in his musical practice to find new sounds and his own voice.

# $ABSTRACT

QBRNTHSS hybrid set is a performance using live coding and acoustic and electronic instruments. For the live coding part, Ramon Casamaj贸 (a.k.a. QBRNTHSS) uses TidalCycles with samples recorded by himself and some Supercollider synths also written by himself. The external sound sources include a trumpet, a processed contact mic, and some effect pedals.

Throughout the live set, QBRNTHSS combines the sounds synthesized or launched from the programming language with those generated with external hardware. The trumpet and processed contact mic can also be recorded, looped, and their sound manipulated from TidalCycles, giving rise to new textures and atmospheres.

In his performances, we can find QBRNTHSS riding the tension between the rhythm and the abstraction, the melody and the noise, the synthetic and the analogic. Hardly influenced by avant-garde musicians that have experimented with the limits of electronic music, like Jon Hassell or Moritz Von Oswald, Ramon Casamaj贸 tries to use live coding in his musical practice to find new sounds and his own voice.
