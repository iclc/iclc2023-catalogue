# $PROGRAM_NOTE

QBRNTHSS hybrid set is a performance using live coding and acoustic and electronic
instruments, including a trumpet, a mini tank drum amplified with a contact mic, an
elektron model cycles synth, and some effect pedals. In his performances, we can
find Ramon Casamaj贸 (a.k.a. QBRNTHSS) riding the tension between the rhythm and
the abstraction, the melody and the noise, the synthetic and the analogic. Hardly
influenced by avant-garde musicians that have experimented with the limits of
electronic music, like Jon Hassell or Moritz Von Oswald, Ramon Casamaj贸 tries to use
live coding in his musical practice to find new sounds and his own voice.

# $ABSTRACT

QBRNTHSS hybrid set is a performance using live coding and acoustic and electronic
instruments. For the live coding part, Ramon Casamaj贸 (a.k.a. QBRNTHSS) uses Tidal
Cycles with samples recorded by himself and some Supercollider synths also written
by himself. The external instruments include a trumpet, a mini tank drum amplified
with a contact mic, an elektron model cycles synth, and some effect pedals.

Throughout the live set, QBRNTHSS combines the sounds synthesized or launched
from the programming language with those generated with external hardware. The
trumpet and mini tank drum can also be recorded, looped, and their sound
manipulated from Tidal Cycles, giving rise to new textures and atmospheres.

In his performances, we can find QBRNTHSS riding the tension between the rhythm
and the abstraction, the melody and the noise, the synthetic and the analogic. Hardly
influenced by avant-garde musicians that have experimented with the limits of
electronic music, like Jon Hassell or Moritz Von Oswald, Ramon Casamaj贸 tries to use
live coding in his musical practice to find new sounds and his own voice.
