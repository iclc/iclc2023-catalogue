# $PROGRAM_NOTE

*AV Counterpoint*: A MIDI-synced live code audiovisual collaboration between dan.dog
and d0n.xyz, running real time data connection between TidalCycles and
moodMatrix, a custom visual system developed by d0n.xyz.

# $ABSTRACT

AV Counterpoint is a collaboration between Don Hanson (d0n.xyz / Visuals) and Dan
Gorelick (dan.dog / Music). The piece focuses on the connection between music and
generative visuals, exploring emergent complex patterns and shapes that are created
by simple building-block patterns in TidalCycles. The visuals are created by d0n.xyzâ€™s
custom Javascript live-coding library, moodMatrix.

Dan Gorelick explores how counterpoint melodies can be created using simple
building-block patterns within TidalCycles. The symmetries and relationships
between the notes can further be appreciated by sending the note data to the visuals
system.

A custom environment maps the signals between the audio and visual systems. MIDI
is used to send the data allowing the music and visuals to be tightly coupled. The
MIDI notes are mapping to pitch and time, and the MIDI cc is connected to
parameters and characteristics of the visuals and sound. The MIDI mapping and
attenuation is controlled live.

Don and Dan have explored and validated the parts of the system in various
performances, including at SXSW Festival, Algorithmic Art Assembly at Gray Area, at
ZeroSpace (Brooklyn, NY), Syzygy (San Francisco), and various other contexts. This
performance is the debut of this new system.
