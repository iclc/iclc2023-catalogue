# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This performance will be using Nodysseus, a work-in-progress livecoding tool. It's a general purpose visual programming language and editor for the web inspired by a combination of node-based live editors and visual effects tools. In this algorave set, I'll be using THREE.js and possibly Hydra integrations along with built-in Nodysseus nodes. The majority of the performance will feature audioreactive 3D objects postprocessed by glsl shaders. I will use basic 3D shapes, particle simulations, and pre-built geometry files, all procedurally manipulated, mixed, and textured by live graph editing. Some of the nodes will be premade, but combining them and adding audio-reactivity will be done live.
