# $PROGRAM_NOTE

After his death, the heirs of Professor Bad Trip found in his old mansion the drawings of
some machines created with the evil intentions of annoying as many people as possible. We
have recovered these drawings to program them again and honor the memory of their
creator. We have not managed to resurrect him, but seeing the Rumble Machines live will
be like having Professor Bad Trip right under your nose.

# $ABSTRACT

My approach to code has always been more about sound design or contemporary
composition than algoraves or nightclubs. By writing large blocks of Tidal code I've
managed to make the abstract, ever-changing music I've always wanted to write. That's
why I have conceived Rumble Machines as a series of short pieces, constantly growing, with
which to approach the aesthetics of composers like Fausto Romitelli, Wolfgang Mitterer or
Aphex Twin to name a few.

Rumble machines unmasks my *horror vacui* or, in other words, my natural tendency to
overload all the music I make. Like a mad doctor, I have programmed several machines,
each with its own personality and internal processes that push the CPU to its limits to
generate delicious noise.
