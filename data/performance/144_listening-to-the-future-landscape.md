# $PROGRAM_NOTE

*Listening to the (Future) Landscape* is a quadraphonic, live-coded sound performance,
incorporating found natural objects, local environmental recordings and voice in an
immersive listening space evocative of our ecological future. The artist has collected
objects and recordings from the local landscape — the city of Utrecht — which become the
primary instruments in the piece. With these artifacts, the artist builds a multi-layered,
virtual space that exists in parallel with — and in tension with — the physical environment.

# $ABSTRACT

I propose a 10-minute quadraphonic sound performance, live-coded in Sonic Pi,
incorporating found natural objects, local environmental recordings and voice in an
immersive listening space evocative of our ecological future. Prior to my performance, I
will collect objects (sticks, leaves, rocks, etc.) and field recordings/contact mic recordings
from the urban landscape of Utrecht which will then become the primary “instruments”
used in the piece. During the performance, I will use Ableton Live to record samples of the
collected objects as well as my voice. I will bring all of these sounds into Sonic Pi to build a
multi-layered, virtual space that exists in parallel with—and in tension with—the physical
environment.

As a multidisciplinary artist and composer, I collaborate with specific environments and
natural objects, giving voice to inanimate things which, like bodies, act upon their
surroundings and contain histories. I animate these bodies via my own body - by
manipulating objects, walking through spaces, or by singing.

I sing the landscape. Besides using samples from the natural world, I harness the
seductiveness and vulnerability of voice and melody in order to build trust with my
audience, create an emotional, communal experience and lead the listener into the
unexpected.

Climate change and resource overconsumption are among the most critical concerns of our
time. I strive to awaken environmental awareness and responsibility by offering a new
connection to the landscape — one experienced through the ears.
