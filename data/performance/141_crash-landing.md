# $PROGRAM_NOTE

An experimental project where three performers share a common code expressed in
different but interdependent languages: text, gesture, image, voice and sound
recordings. Lina will generate music and sound textures using Tidal Cycles, Citlali
will be recording voice live loops using body gestures with motion sensors, and Roger
will be generating visuals with his own [*Animatron*](https://github.com/loopier/animatron) tool dedicated to live coded
animation. «CRash Landing» represents a metaphor between a plane flight and a
live coding performance, starting with a from scratch and finishing with a crash.

# $ABSTRACT

An experimental project where three performers share a common code expressed in
different but interdependent languages: text, gesture, image, voice and sound
recordings. Lina will generate music and sound textures using TidalCycles, Citlali will
be recording voice live loops using body gestures with motion sensors, and Roger will
be generating visuals with his own [*Animatron*](https://github.com/loopier/animatron) tool, dedicated to live coded
animation.

As the performance progresses, the performers send and receive OSC messages
between them, affecting its other actions and codes. For example, as usual, music
affects how Citlali dances, but in this performance, her gestures change the sound
that she’s dancing to, she also affects the animation and her gesture code will also
make voice loops.

«CRash Landing» represents a metaphor between a plane flight and a live coding
performance, with a 'from scratch' beginning and crashing at the end:
The performance starts with reading aloud the safety card instructions of a
commercial flight that is about to take off and music starts playing. Citlali starts to
make a body movements sequence, visibly used to record and play audio loops.
Once this process is established, Roger and Lina create new sound layers by
modifying the audio loops with code. The visuals (which are at the same time
animated videoclips of Citlali dancing) are controlled by Roger. Lina and Citlali
modify the visuals without Roger’s intervention. Citlali and Roger control the audio.
Everyone influences and takes control of each other's codes. This crazy feedback
party goes on until our plane and the performance crashes. As a performer, you may
know this is what live coding feels like.

«CRash Landing» was presented in beta version during 
[on-the-fly.collect(\_)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0IyM0kF1mM) event. The
performance for the ICLC is therefore, intended to be an extended version,
incorporating Lina’s work and the Animatron tool of Roger.
