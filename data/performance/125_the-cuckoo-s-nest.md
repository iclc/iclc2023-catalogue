# $PROGRAM_NOTE

Morris is a traditional dance in which small teams (six to ten) step and clap sticks in group
formation. In St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex there is a new side/team of dancers called 'Rheda's 
Dream' led by Amy Ruth Cullis. Jude Montague has been setting up a new series of Algoraves 
locally and together they are creating an interweaving of Morris dance and algorithms, inspired
by Alex McClean's work with patterns and computer code. The performance will feature dancing 
by Amy Ruth Cullis and will use code to interact with the audience as instructions. Those of 
the audience who wish can take part in a processional dance. The experience will bring together
early modern and new dance.
