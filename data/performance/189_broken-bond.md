# $PROGRAM_NOTE

"Broken Bond" is a live coding performance exploring the broken connections between
technology and humanity. Through a combination of live coding and sound manipulation,
this performance will explore how technology has both connected and disconnected us
from others. Audience members will experience an immersive soundscape that will
heighten their senses to the complexities of our modern technological landscape.

# $ABSTRACT

“Broken Bond” explores the destruction of human and technology relationships and the
emotional journey of rebuilding oneself after a traumatic experience. This performance
draws inspiration from Naruto: The Broken Bond, a fighting game retelling the Sasuke
Retrieval story arc from the Japanese anime series Naruto. Through a combination of live
coding and electronic music, the performance will explore themes of loss, grief, and healing
in a multipart multimedia performance. Using Max/MSP, visuals from the show serve as
story points as the musical performance unfolds. The performance will begin with a
soundscape of unsettling, dissonant tones to evoke a sense of tension and unease in the
style of atmospheric drum and bass. This soundscape will be created using slicing
techniques I developed within Sonic Pi, playing with rhythmic displacement. As the
performance progresses, the music will draw more from Coltrane's jazz style, becoming
more melodic and hopeful as the protagonist begins their journey towards recovery. The
performance will culminate in a triumphant, uplifting finale that celebrates the resilience of
the human spirit. A powerful and emotionally engaging experience, the audience will
explore the pain of a broken bond and the hope of rebuilding one's life afterwards.
