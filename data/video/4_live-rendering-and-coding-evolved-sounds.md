# $PROGRAM_NOTE

synth.is offers sound discovery with evolutionary methods. Discovered sound genomes can be published and rendered at any duration and pitch for live coding with the integrated Glicol live coding engine. Steps from live coding performances can be recorded and published at URLs like: [https://synth.is/live-coding/01G9XMVDSCS65F52CY1X9GXQ6T](https://synth.is/live-coding/01G9XMVDSCS65F52CY1X9GXQ6T)

When such an URL is visited, a single JSON file weighing a few kilobytes is downloaded, containing genomes for all the sounds, which are rendered in the browser before the performance, and a sequence of all the recorded "live" coding steps, which are played back in the video.
