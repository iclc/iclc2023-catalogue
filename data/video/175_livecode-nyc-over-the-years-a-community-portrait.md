# $PROGRAM_NOTE

This piece was originally created as a generative site-specific installation at the cell for a residency awarded to LiveCode.NYC by Flux Factory, where the video was projection mapped onto panels built-into the space. I use Max/MSP to mix and blend various images, videos, and posters of LiveCode.NYC members and events to create a generative video work. By showcasing past and current events and using materials created by multiple members, this installation is a homage to the community andhighlights its' collective efforts and visions. It is a piece that I intend to work on and expand over the years. I am also interested in exploring this framework for other communities.
