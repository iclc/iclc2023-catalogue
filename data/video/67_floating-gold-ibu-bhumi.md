# $PROGRAM_NOTE

‘Ibu Bhumi’ is one of eight audiovisual pieces created by Floating Gold: Peni Candra Rini, Rangga Purnama Aji and Gamelan Naga Mas. Floating Gold was formed to explore the potential of international collaboration through livecoding. Over a series of improvisatory workshops in Estuary, Rangga Purnama Aji worked alongside four livecoding musicians from Gamelan Naga Mas to record a series of musical backings using gamelan samples recorded from the ‘Spirit of Hope’ gamelan instruments in Glasgow. Peni Candra Rini wrote, performed and filmed a series of Javanese texts based on the musical materials created, exploring themes of motherhood, the sea, and ancient kingdoms, that themselves drew on the legend of St Thenue, the ‘Mother of Glasgow’. ‘Ibu Bhumi’ means ‘Mother Earth’ – ‘Aku ibu, ib bhumi aku’, ‘I am a Mother, Mother Earth is me.’
