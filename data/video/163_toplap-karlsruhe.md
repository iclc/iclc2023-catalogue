# $PROGRAM_NOTE

At the borders of the black forest, the city of Karlsruhe has curiously been a fertile ground for live coding in the past years, benefiting from the presence of such institutions as the ZKM (Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe) and particularly the IMWI (Institute for Music Informatics and Musicology, University of Music Karlsruhe), birthplace of the notorious "Beno√Æt and the Mandelbrots", host to the live.code.festival in 2013 and up until today an international place of study and encounter of many a fellow TOPLAPer. 

Involvement in and awareness of academia, the experimental music scene and contemporary club culture shapes the community's diversity, yielding abstract sonic finesse, dancefloor bangers, noise pyrotechnics and more conceptual approaches in audiovisual media. 

TOPLAP Karlsruhe wants to bundle local forces in live coding, create spaces of open encounter and exchange, organize workshops, concerts and connect with other live coding communities all around the globe.
