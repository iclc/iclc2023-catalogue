# $PROGRAM_NOTE

(- the video is multiple shorts now combined and this note only refers to the first - please can you provide a combined text/updated program note for the whole? )

Atari 2600 Video Remix is a series composed by video remix, sound art and live coding. The video refers to the historical period of Bras√≠lia city (Brazil capital federal) constructed between the years 1956 and 1960, mixed with the Atari 2600 game 'Pitfall!' (released by Activision in 1982). The sounds are produced by live coding using Tidal Cycles and audio samples from the game 'Pitfall!'.
