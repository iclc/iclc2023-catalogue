# $PROGRAM_NOTE

The video is a series of video remix, sound art and live coding inspired by the
game console Atari 2600, mixed with historical pictures of
Bras√≠lia city (Brazil capital federal),
and Salvador city (also called: _The biggest carnival in the world_).
The sounds were made by live coding with Tidal Cycles,
using sound samples extracted from the selected games, including
_Pitfall!_ (released by Activision in 1982),
_Enduro_ (released by Activision in 1983),
_River Raid_ (published by Activision in 1982),
_Keystone Kapers_ (developed and published by Activision in 1983),
_Megamania_ (released by Activision in 1982), and
_Pac-Man_ (developed and published by Atari, Inc. in 1982).

The series is a work-in-progress and soon new eposodes will be released, you
can find more info and news on the links below.
