# $ABSTRACT

In this text I deploy Nancy Fraser's theory of the 'triple movement' to
analyse and re-imagine the node of techno-scientific art practice,
paying attention to the Mexican art context and the imagined
(trans-national) community of live coding. From Fraser's ideas, I
provide an analysis of Actor-Network Theory and a general comment on
technofeminism as a set of theoretical frameworks insufficient for
integrating emancipation properly into artistic and scientific
practices.
