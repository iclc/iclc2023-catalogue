# $ABSTRACT

We present a reproducible music information retrieval (MIR) study on 133
performances from the 10th anniversary of Algorave. Our aim in this
paper is to provide a reproducible framework for computational analysis
of musical performances. Here, we present a tool for analysing
acoustical characteristics and for visualizing the musical structure
from performances of one algorave event. Our musical analysis of the
live coding performances highlights the musical diversity within the
live coding community to a broader scientific audience. At the same
time, we expect that the algoravers will gain insights on their own
musical practices through the computational analysis of the musical
structure of their performances. In concerning ourselves with
reproducibility, our intention is to motivate more researchers to
analyse musical practices of other under-represented music communities.
As a basic tool for reproducibility we construct a pipeline for
analysing performances using Python within a Jupyter notebook. To make
this reproducible on different computers we wrapped the whole workflow
setup into a docker image. We represent the results of our analysis as a
series of plots of different kinds. These plots present both overviews
of the entire repertory in compact form, and comparisons of individual
pieces in more detail. In learning one can use such visualization as a
means for raising awareness on one's evolution of the musical outcome.
In performance this visualization can be developed to a real-time and
possibly an interactive tool which informs the coder about the musical
outcome of a live set on-the-fly. Finally, we reflect on how and to what
extent such MIR studies can provide valuable insights in live coding
performance practices, while also considering the limitations faced when
dealing with such large parameter spaces in human machine musicianship.
