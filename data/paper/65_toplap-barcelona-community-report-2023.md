# $ABSTRACT

Barcelona has developed an active community of live coders.
This report traces back the history and development of the
TOPLAP Barcelona node, from its predecessors and roots, through
its founding as a collective, to the present day.
In addition, it presents its ongoing activities and how they shape
the character of the community as we can see it today.
