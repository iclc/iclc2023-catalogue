# $ABSTRACT

With the advent of real-time computer music programming languages,
specialized practices have arisen. Live coding (LC) and SCTweeting (SCT)
are significant examples of creative constraint-coding approaches to
computer music. The former consists of improvised live-electronic music
in which performers project their coding screen. The latter is the
practice of code golfing for creating (and sharing on social media)
140-character codes that generate complex sounds. In this paper we seek
to approximate these two, drawing a comparative conceptualization and
outlining possible artistic and contextual bonds between them. We
analyze how both scenes, being new forms of artistic practices, propose
radical and non-traditional approaches to coding. For that, LC and SCT
are associated with the concepts and theoretical elaborations of
cybernetics and mechanology, such as *feedback loops* as well as the
*isodynamism* between technical behavior and human thought. Thereupon,
we discuss how constraints play an important role in LC and SCT to
develop ideas and achieve idiosyncratic artistic results. Finally, we
outline some possible interweaving and didactic potential that have been
latent in both practices.
