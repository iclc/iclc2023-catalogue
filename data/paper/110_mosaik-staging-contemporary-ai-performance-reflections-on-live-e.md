# $ABSTRACT

This paper introduces our collective work ``Patterns in Between
Intelligences'', a performance piece that builds an artistic practice
between live coding sounds and coding through dance, mediated and shaped
through e-textile sensors. This creates a networked system of which both
live coded processes and human bodies are part. The paper describes in
detail the implementations of technology used in the prototype
performance performed at No Bounds Festival in Sheffield UK, October
2022, as well as discussions and concerns the team had related to the
use of AI technology on stage. The paper concludes with a narrative
reflection on the Sheffield performance, and reflections on it.
