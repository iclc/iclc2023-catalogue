# $ABSTRACT

The Netherlands Coding Live a.k.a. NL_CL is a "pop-up" phygital space for engaging with live coding through practice, experimentation, openness, discussions and performance. Series of live coding sessions, discussions, workshops and more have been organized by live coders based in The Netherlands and hosted in various cities across the country. Many members of NL_CL are also employed or in close contact with other platforms, foundations or institutes such as the instrument inventors initiative (iii) in The Hague, Creative Coding Utrecht (CCU), Varia in Rotterdam, Creative Coding Amsterdam (CCA), The Institute of Sonology in The Hague, The HKU University of the Arts Utrecht and the Conservatory of Amsterdam (CvA). By applying for subsidy at different funds like Creative Industries Fund NL (SCI) and Fund Performing Arts (FPK) NL_CL has been able to organize many events such as concerts and workshops in collaboration or via these parties. NL_CL is an open community where everyone with an interest in coding is welcome to join. The community has a diverse practice of disciplines in which live coding is applied. These disciplines range from programming music (in the broadest definition possible) and visuals to working with choreography and embodiment or building, augmenting and designing acoustic and physical instruments. Much of the tools and research by the community are also published and shared. Furthermore the community is quite diverse in nationalities with members from for example Brazil, Argentina, Slovenia, USA, Mexico, Portugal, Italy and of course The Netherlands.
