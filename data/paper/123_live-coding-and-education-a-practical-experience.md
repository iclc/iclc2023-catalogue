# $ABSTRACT

This paper presents an explorative research on the introduction of live
coding into the Italian music curriculum in middle school with the aim
of offering teachers a multidisciplinary didactic tool that can enhance
the learning experience of students. The research focuses on the
challenges that music teachers face when introducing live coding in
their curricular activity and the type of training that can prepare them
for it. The paper covers three main points: the training of teachers,
the pedagogical strategies employed in the classrooms, and an overview
of the results of the first year of experimentation. Overall, the paper
aims to offer insight into the potential benefits and challenges of
using live coding as a teaching tool in music education and highlights
its potential for multidisciplinary applications, while also showing
possible paths for future work and improvement.
