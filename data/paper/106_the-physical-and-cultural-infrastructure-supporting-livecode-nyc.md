# $ABSTRACT

LivecodeNYC is New York City's community of nerds and artists writing
software on stage to make music, visuals, games and other live art in
front of audiences. This community report offers a look into the various
factors that make up the ground reality of running a live coding
community in New York City, and how it influences our ways of working,
successes and challenges.
