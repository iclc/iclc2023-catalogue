# $ABSTRACT

Živa is a quark aimed to simplify the live coding experience in
SuperCollider, both to quickly set up the environment and to code in a
sparse and clear syntax.

This paper describes the reasons that led the author to develop it and
his procedures in doing so. The paper introduces the problems
encountered when using other languages, and the solutions found in
SuperCollider to solve them. This is not a research paper, but a report
of the motivation, proceedings and achieved results of the developer's
experience in creating this subset of tools for SuperCollider.
