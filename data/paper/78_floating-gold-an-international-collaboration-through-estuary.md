# $ABSTRACT

Between December 2020 and November 2022 the Glasgow-based community
group Gamelan Naga Mas worked remotely with two Indonesian musicians,
Peni Candra Rini and Rangga Purnama Aji. This musical collaboration was
made possible by the Estuary platform, which allowed for real-time
livecoded improvisations between locations in Scotland, Indonesia, and
the USA. In this paper we discuss and reflect upon the technical,
musical, and human factors that have made this project a success and
indicate some directions for future exploration.
