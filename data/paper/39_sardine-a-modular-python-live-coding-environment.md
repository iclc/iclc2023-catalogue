# $ABSTRACT

**Sardine** is a live coding environment and library for Python 3.10+ focusing on the modularity and extensibility of several base components (clocks, parsers, handlers). **Sardine** has been designed to be easily integrated with existing live coding environments as both a tool for experimentation, and a demonstration of various live coding techniques: temporal recursion, patterning, integration in various hardware and software setups. Although the tool is still in active early development, it has already been used in multiple public performances and algoraves, partly enabled by its support for MIDI IN/Out, OSC IN/Out and *SuperCollider/SuperDirt* one-way communication through OSC.This paper is dedicated to the introduction of the **Sardine** system, and the explanation of the main guidelines currently followed by contributors to the project. It will also present the preliminary results of our work through practical realisations that served as experimental validation during the early stages of development.
