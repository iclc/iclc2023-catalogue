# $ABSTRACT

We present Genny, a live coding interface for interacting with
generative models. By implementing a streamlined generative model API
within a Web-based live coding environment, we explore possibilities for
how generative models can support live coding. We describe the implementation of our interface components and the backend system for
working with generative models, show several design patterns with
template code, and describe use of a practical generation method for
live coding performance. The system currently enables the generation of
two-bar rhythm patterns using lightweight models that support
near-instantaneous inference, which are able to suggest and display
alternative rhythm patterns based on live coders' own inputs. Finally,
we discuss reflections on this implementation approach, its current
limitations, and further possibilities.
