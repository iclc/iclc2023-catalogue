# $ABSTRACT

Ziffers is an algorithmic number based musical notation for live coding.
It offers concise syntax to support composition and improvisation with
complex melodies and rhythms. Ziffers is the result of experiments in
unifying several types of musical notation centred around the use of
symbols and numbers. It is inspired by the older numbered musical
notations (\emph{Ziffersystem}, \emph{Jianpu}), contemporary music
theory (pitch-class sets, post-tonal music analysis, serialism) and
shorthand notations used in live-coding. Ziffers aims for a balance
between fixed media music notation and generative notations for live
coding performance. In this article, we propose an implementation
agnostic numbered notation for algorithmic composition and live coding.
As a proof of concept, this article will also present a live-coding
framework for Ziffers notation and an export plugin for a general
purpose scorewriter. In doing so, we hope to highlight the versatility
of our approach in using unified syntax for different contexts of
execution and interpretation.
