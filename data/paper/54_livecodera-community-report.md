# $ABSTRACT

In March of 2022, LivecoderA, a new live coding community came into
being, coalescing around the need to recognize a specific cohort of live
coders who identify as women. The group is inherently feminist and
intersectional, and its creation was motivated by many desires. Among
them: solidarity and visibility, to be counted as sisters, and to
reflect to each other the strength of our numbers. A manifesto and
several events have since been produced, and the community is active
online while also making more in-person connections whenever possible
through the coordination of gigs, residencies and meetups. At the time
of publishing, the community connects through Telegram and Discord, with
channels consisting of 48 and 27 members respectively.
