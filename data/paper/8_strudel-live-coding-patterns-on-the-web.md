# $ABSTRACT

This paper introduces Strudel, which faithfully ports the TidalCycles
approach to live coding algorithmic patterns to native JavaScript and
the web. We begin by giving a little background of the first year of
development, before sharing some detail about its implementation and
examples of use. We go on to outline the wide range of synthesis and
other outputs available in Strudel, including WebAudio, MIDI, OSC (for
SuperDirt), WebSerial and CSound, and introduce Strudel's REPL live
editor, including its built-in visualisations. We then compare Strudel
with Tidal, the trade-offs involved between JavaScript and Haskell, and
the unique capabilities offered by Strudel for aligning patterns, before
concluding with some thoughts about the future.
