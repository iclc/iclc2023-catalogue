# $ABSTRACT

We present LambDAW, a novel system for integrating computation and
composition that brings code directly into the digital audio workstation
(DAW). It allows the composer to freely mix static and dynamic materials
by embedding short expressions of code in the DAW timeline that generate
audio and MIDI on demand. LambDAW moves code out of the text editor and
computation out of the effects chain, bringing both into the timeline
where they can refer to and transform other items. We propose that this
move makes code more tangible and enables the composer to easily bring
generativity into their existing practices. Additionally, we discuss
LambDAW's affordances and implications for live coding. LambDAW takes
the form of an open-source REAPER extension that executes Python code
embedded in projects, enabling the user to benefit from both the
existing REAPER and Python ecosystems.
